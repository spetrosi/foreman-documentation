= Registering a Host to {ProjectName} Using the Global Registration Template

Use the following procedure to register a host to {ProjectNameX}.

With this registration method you can register hosts to {Project} by generating a `curl` command on {Project} and running this command on hosts.
This method uses the global registration template that gives you complete control over the process of the host registration.

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
Note that you can extend the parameters by plug-ins. For more information, see https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/blob/develop/developer_docs/how_to_create_a_plugin.asciidoc.
endif::[]

.Prerequisites
* The {Project} user that generates the `curl` command must have the `create_hosts` permission.
* You must have root privileges on the host that you want to register.

.Procedure
. In {Project} web UI, navigate to *Hosts* > *Provisioning Templates* and locate and click *Linux registration default*.

. Click the *Association* tab.

. Select the operating systems that you want to register.

. Navigate to *Hosts* > *Operating Systems* and click the operating system that you want to register.

. Click *Submit*.

. Click the *Templates* tab.

. From the *Registration template* list, select *Linux registration default*.

. Click *Submit*.

. Navigate to *Hosts* > *All Hosts* > *Register Host*.

. Optional: If you want to register hosts to {SmartProxy}, enter the following command on the {SmartProxy} to enable required modules:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# foreman-installer --foreman-proxy-registration \
--foreman-proxy-templates \
--foreman-proxy-template-url 'http://{smartproxy-example-com}'
----

. What fields are required for Satellite and Foreman?

. Optional: From the *Host Group* list, select the host group to associate the hosts with.

. From the *Operating System* list, select the operating system of hosts that you want to register.

. Optional: If you want to register hosts to a {SmartProxy}, from the *{SmartProxy}* list, select the {SmartProxy} to register hosts to.

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
. Optional: If you do not want to register hosts with Insights, from the *Insights* list, select *No*. What are the defaults for those two?
endif::[]

. Optional: If you do not want to deploy {Project} SSH keys to hosts, from the *Remote Execution* list, select *No*.

. Optional: {Project} uses the JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
This duration of this token defines how long the generated `curl` command works.
If you want to change the duration of the token, enter the required duration to the *Token lifetime (hours)* field.
You can set the duration to any number of hours.
+
Note that {Project} uses the permissions of the user who generated the `curl` command for authorization of hosts.
If user loses or gains additional permissions, the permissions of the JWT change too.
Therefore, do not delete, block, or change permissions of the user during the token duration.

. Optional: What is remote execution interface?

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
. In the *Activation Key(s)* field, enter one or more activation keys to assign to registered hosts.
endif::[]

. Click *Generate command*.

. Copy the generated `curl` command to enter it on the hosts.

. On the hosts that you want to register, enter the generated `curl` command as `root`.

.SSL
For calling Foreman endpoints via https CA authority must be installed on the host.
Path to CA file can be found in Settings > Authentication > SSL CA file.

If you don't want to upload & install CA on the host, you can run first `curl` command
with `---insecure` parameter, like this:

[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
curl -X GET --insecure https://foreman.example.com/register | bash
----

This make first call insecure, however Global Registration template will
download CA and will use it for secure connections for any other calls to the Foreman.

.Customizing the Templates

Note that all default templates in Foreman are locked.
If you want to customize the registration process, you need to clone the default Global registration template and change the *Default Global registration template* setting in *Administer* > *Settings* > *Provisioning*.

You can configure the following global parameters by navigating to *Configure* > *Global Parameters*:

* The `host_registration_remote_execution` parameter is used in the `remote_execution_ssh_keys` snippet, the default value is `true`.

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
* The `host_registration_insights` parameter is used in the `insights` snippet, the default value is `false`.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* The `host_registration_insights` parameter is used in the `insights` snippet, the default value is `true`.
endif::[]
