= Configuring {Project} for UEFI HTTP Boot IPv6 Provisioning

Use this procedure to configure {Project} to provision hosts in an IPv6 network with UEFI HTTP Boot provisioning.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that your clients can access DHCP and TFTP servers.

* Ensure that the UDP ports 67 and 68 are accessible by clients so clients can send DHCP requests and receive DHCP offers.

* Ensure that the TCP port 8000 is open for the client to download files and Kickstart templates from {SmartProxy}.

* Ensure that the host provisioning interface subnet has a TFTP {SmartProxy}, and Templates {SmartProxy} set. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.7/html/provisioning_guide/configuring_networking#Configuring_Networking-Adding_a_Subnet_to_the_Satellite_Server[Adding a Subnet to {ProjectServer}] in the _Provisioning Guide_.

.Procedure

. Since clients that are booting from network cannot be identified by remote IPv6 address due to unmanaged DHCPv6 service, you must enable provisioning tokens. To enable provisioning tokens, navigate to *Administer* > *Settings* > *Provisioning* and set the *Token duration* setting to 0.

. You must disable DHCP management in the installer or not use it.

. For all IPv6 subnets created in {Project}, set the *DHCP {SmartProxy}* to blank.

. Optional: If the host and the DHCP server are separated by a router, configure the DHCP relay agent and point to the DHCP server.

. Update the `grub2-efi` package to the latest version:

----
# {package-install-project} grub2-efi
----

. Optional: If native IPv6 connectivity is not available, configure an HTTP proxy in {Project} and set it as the default proxy in settings. For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.8-beta/html/installing_satellite_server_from_a_connected_network/performing-additional-configuration#adding-a-default-http-proxy_satellite[Adding a Default HTTP Proxy to Satellite].

. Synchronize the {RHEL} 8 kickstart repository.
