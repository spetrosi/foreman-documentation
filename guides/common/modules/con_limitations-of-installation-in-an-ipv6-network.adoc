= Limitations of {Project} Installation in an IPv6 Network 

{Project} installation in an IPv6 network has the following limitations:

* DHCP server in {RHEL} (ISC DHCP) does not provide an integration API for managing IPv6 records, therefore {SmartProxy} DHCP plug-in that provides DHCP management is limited to IPv4 subnets. In this scenario, DHCP IPv6 must be deployed as a separate unmanaged service to bootstrap client nodes into grub2, which then configures IPv6 networking either using DHCPv6 or via static IPv6 address.
* Although provisioning templates which ship with {Project} include IPv6 support for PXE and HTTP (iPXE) scenarios, the only tested and certified workflow is UEFI HTTP Boot.
