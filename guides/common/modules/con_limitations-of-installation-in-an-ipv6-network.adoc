= Limitations of {Project} Installation in an IPv6 Network 

{Project} installation in an IPv6 network has the following limitations:

* DHCP server in {RHEL} (ISC DHCP) does not provide an integration API for managing IPv6 records, therefore {SmartProxy} DHCP plug-in that provides DHCP management is limited to IPv4 subnets. In this scenario, DHCP IPv6 must be deployed as a separate unmanaged service to bootstrap client nodes into grub2, which then configures IPv6 networking either using DHCPv6 or via static IPv6 address.
* Although {Project} provisioning templates include IPv6 support for PXE and HTTP (iPXE) provisioning, the only tested and certified provisioning workflow is the UEFI HTTP Boot provisioning. This limitation only relates to users who plan to use {Project} to provision hosts.
