= Requirements for {Project} Installation in an IPv6 Network 

Before installing {Project} in an IPv6 network, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

ifeval::["{build}" == "satellite"]
* If you plan to provision hosts from {Project} or {SmartProxies}, you must install {Project} and {SmartProxies} on {RHEL} version 7.9 or higher because these versions include the latest version of the `grub2` package.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build}" != "satellite"]
* If you plan to provision hosts from {Project} or {SmartProxy}, you must install {Project} and {SmartProxies} on a system with `grub2` version 2.05 or higher or system with fixes for HTTP Boot, for example CentOS version 7.9 or 8.3 or higher. For other operating systems, copy the newest GRUB build to `/var/lib/tftpboot/grub2/grubx64.efi`.
endif::[]

* You can install {Project} and {SmartProxies} in IPv6-only systems, dual-stack installation not supported.

* Optional: If native IPv6 internet connectivity is not available, configure an HTTP proxy to download RPM packages:
