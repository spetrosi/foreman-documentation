= Configuring Group Mapping for {Keycloak} Authentication

To implement the Role Based Access Control (RBAC), create groups in {Project}, assign a role to that group and then map an Active Directory group to that {Project} group.
This means that anyone in the given group in {Keycloak} will be under the corresponding {Project} group.
This example configures users of the {Project}-admin user group in the Active Directory to authenticate as users with administer privileges on {Project}.

.Procedure

. In the {Project} web UI, navigate to *Administer* > *User Groups*, and click the *Create User Group* button.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the user group.
The name should not be the same as in the Active Directory.
. Do not add users and user groups to the right-hand columns.
Click the *Roles* tab.
. Select the *Administer* check box.
. Click the *External Groups* tab.
. Click the *Add external user group* button.
. In the *Name* field, enter the name of the Active Directory group.
. From the list, select *EXTERNAL*.
