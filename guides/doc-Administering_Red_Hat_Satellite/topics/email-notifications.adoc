[id='email-notifications_{context}']
= Email Notifications

Email notifications are created by Satellite Server periodically or after completion of certain events. The periodic notifications can be sent daily, weekly or monthly.

The events that trigger a notification are the following:

- Host build
- Content View promotion
- Error reported by host
- Repository sync

Users do not receive any email notifications by default. An administrator can configure users to receive notifications based on criteria such as the type of notification, and frequency.

[NOTE]
====
If you want email notifications sent to a group's email address, instead of an individual's email address, create a user account with the group's email address and minimal Satellite permissions, then subscribe the user account to the desired notification types.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Satellite Server does not enable outgoing emails by default, therefore you must review your email configuration.
