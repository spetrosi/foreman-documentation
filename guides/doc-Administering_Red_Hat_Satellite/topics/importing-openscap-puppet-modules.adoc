= Importing OpenSCAP Puppet Modules

[NOTE]
If you do not use Puppet to configure OpenSCAP auditing on hosts, you can skip this procedure.

To audit hosts with OpenSCAP, you must first import a Puppet environment. The Puppet environment contains the Puppet classes you must assign to each host to deploy the OpenSCAP configuration.

You must associate each host that you want to audit with the Puppet environment in the Satellite web UI.

.Procedure

. In the Satellite web UI, navigate to *Configure* > *Environments*.
. Click *Import environments from _satellite.example.com_*.
. Select the Puppet environment check box associated with the host you want to audit.
+
If no Puppet environment exists, select the *production* environment check box. The Puppet classes that you require for OpenSCAP are in the *production* environment by default.
. Click *Update*.
