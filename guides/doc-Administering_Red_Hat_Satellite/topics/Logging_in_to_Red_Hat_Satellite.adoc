=== Installing the Katello Root CA Certificate

The first time you log on to Satellite, you might see a warning informing you that you are using the default self-signed certificate and you might not be able to connect this browser to Satellite until the root CA certificate is installed in the browser. Use the following procedure to locate the root CA certificate on Satellite and to install it in your browser.

.Prerequisites

Your Red{nbsp}Hat Satellite is installed and configured.

.Procedure

. Identify the fully qualified domain name of your Satellite Server:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# hostname -f
----

. Access the `pub` directory on your Satellite Server using a web browser pointed to the fully qualified domain name:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
https://_satellite.example.com_/pub
----

. When you access Satellite for the first time, an untrusted connection warning displays in your web browser. Accept the self-signed certificate and add the Satellite URL as a security exception to override the settings. This procedure might differ depending on the browser being used. Ensure that the Satellite URL is valid before you accept the security exception.

. Select `katello-server-ca.crt`.

. Import the certificate into your browser as a certificate authority and trust it to identify websites.

.Importing the Katello Root CA Certificate Manually

If you cannot add a security exception in your browser, import the Katello root CA certificate manually.

. From the Satellite CLI, copy the `katello-server-ca.crt` file to the machine you use to access the web UI:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes"]
----
# scp /var/www/html/pub/katello-server-ca.crt \
_username@hostname:remotefile_
----

. In the browser, import the `katello-server-ca.crt` certificate as a certificate authority and trust it to identify websites.
