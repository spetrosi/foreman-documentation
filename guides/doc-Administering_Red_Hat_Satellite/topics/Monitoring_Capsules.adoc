==== Viewing General Capsule Information

Navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Capsules* to view a table of Capsule Servers registered to the Satellite Server. The information contained in the table answers the following questions:

*Is the Capsule Server running?*:: This is indicated by a green icon in the *Status* column. A red icon indicates an inactive Capsule, use the `service foreman-proxy restart` command on the Capsule Server to activate it.

*What services are enabled on the Capsule Server?*:: In the *Features* column you can verify if the Capsule for example provides a DHCP service or acts as a Pulp node. Capsule features can be enabled during installation or configured in addition. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/installing_capsule_server/[Installing Capsule Server].

*What organizations and locations is the Capsule Server assigned to?*:: A Capsule Server can be assigned to multiple organizations and locations, but only Capsules belonging to the currently selected organization are displayed. To list all Capsules, select *Any Organization* from the context menu in the top left corner.

After changing the Capsule configuration, select *Refresh* from the drop-down menu in the *Actions* column to make sure the Capsule table is up to date.

Click the Capsule name to view further details. At the *Overview* tab, you can find the same information as in the Capsule table. In addition, you can answer to the following questions:

*Which hosts are managed by the Capsule Server?*:: The number of associated hosts is displayed next to the *Hosts managed* label. Click the number to view the details of associated hosts.

*How much storage space is available on the Capsule Server?*:: The amount of storage space occupied by the Pulp content in `/var/lib/pulp`, `/var/lib/pulp/content`, and `/var/lib/mongodb` is displayed. Also the remaining storage space available on the Capsule can be ascertained.

Navigate to *Infrastructure* > *Capsules* and click the name of the selected Capsule. At the *Services* tab, you can find basic information on Capsule services, such as the list of DNS domains, or the number of Pulp workers.
