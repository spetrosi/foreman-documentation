= Backup and Restore Capsule Server Using a Virtual Machine Snapshot

If your Capsule Server is a virtual machine, you can restore it from a snapshot. Creating weekly snapshots to restore from is recommended. In the event of failure, you can install, or configure a new Capsule Server, and then synchronize the database content from Satellite Server.

If required, deploy a new Capsule Server, ensuring the host name is the same as before, and then install the Capsule certificates. You may still have them on Satellite Server, the package name ends in -certs.tar, alternately create new ones. Follow the procedures in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/{ProductVersion}/html/installing_capsule_server/[Installing Capsule Server] until you can confirm, in the web UI, that Capsule Server is connected to Satellite Server. Then use the procedure xref:synchronizing-an-external-capsule_{context}[] to synchronize from Satellite.
