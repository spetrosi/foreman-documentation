== Renaming Satellite Server or Capsule Server

To rename Satellite{nbsp}Server or Capsule{nbsp}Server, you must use the `satellite-change-hostname` script.

If you rename Satellite{nbsp}Server, you must reregister all Satellite clients and configure each Capsule Server to point them to the new Satellite host name. If you use custom SSL certificates, you must regenerate them with the new host name. If you use virt-who, you must update the virt-who configuration files with the new host name.

If you rename Capsule{nbsp}Server, you must reregister all Capsule clients and update the Capsule host name in the Satellite web UI. If you use custom SSL certificates, you must regenerate them with the new host name.

[WARNING]
====
The renaming process shuts down all Satellite{nbsp}Server services on the host being renamed. When the renaming is complete, all services are restarted.
