* Assign an OpenSCAP Capsule.
* Assign a Puppet environment that contains the Puppet classes to deploy the OpenSCAP policies.
* Assign the `foreman_scap_client` and `foreman_scap_client::params` Puppet classes.
* Assign any compliance policies that you want to add.

For information about creating and administering hosts, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.5/html/managing_hosts/index[Managing Hosts] guide.
