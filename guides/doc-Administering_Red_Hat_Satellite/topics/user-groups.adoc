[id='user-groups_{context}']
= User Groups

With Red Hat Satellite, you can assign permissions to groups of users. You can also create user groups as collections of other user groups. If using an external authentication source, you can map Satellite user groups to external user groups as described in xref:sect-Red_Hat_Satellite-Administering_Red_Hat_Satellite-Creating_User_Groups-Configuring_External_User_Groups[].

User groups are defined in an organizational context, meaning that you must select an organization before you can access user groups.
